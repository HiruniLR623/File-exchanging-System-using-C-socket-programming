# Torrent File Exchange Scenario

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified torrent-like file exchange system using socket programming in C. The system consists of a server that handles multiple client connections and serves files to the clients upon request. 

## Features

**The server can handle multiple client connections simultaneously using multi-processing.
**Clients can request and download files from the server in chunks of 1024 bytes.
**The system supports transferring any type of file (text, binary, etc.).
**The client displays the progress of the file download with a progress bar.
**The server logs all client connections and file transfers, including details like the clientâ€™s IP address, connection time, requested file, and transfer success.

## How to Run

**Server

1. Compile the server program using the following command:
	make -f makesvr
   server.out: srv9362.o sig_child.o send_list.o send_file.o log_info.o
	cc -o server.out srv9362.o sig_child.o send_list.o send_file.o log_info.o


2. Run the server:
   ./server.out

**Client

1. Compile the client program using the following command:
	make -f makeclient
   client.out: cli2219.o recv_file.o
	cc -o client.out cli2219.o recv_file.o
2. Run the client:
  	./client.out
